        <h1 id="giphy-react-search">Giphy + React search</h1>
<p>Done as a challenge and practice. This is built on React. Built in about a day.</p>
<h3 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h3>
<ul>
<li><code>git clone https://github.com/atom/markdown-preview.git</code> and <code>cd</code> into it</li>
<li><code>npm install</code></li>
<li><code>npm run start</code></li>
</ul>
<p>If you would like to know more about the documentation and thought process behind this project, .<code>then()</code> read on! Otherwise, the above is all you need to get started.</p>
<h3 id="approach">Approach</h3>
<p>Originally, I thought about building just a basic search input where you enter a query and click a CTA or press enter to get your response, but I wanted to try <em>something different, dammit</em>! I wanted to challenge myself! So, I tried my hand at performing the search by cutting the middle man and search without needing to click a button!</p>
<p>There are absolutely better ways to my solution, but I had fun touching upon code <em>and</em> design. It&#39;s what makes me really happy to do what I do! That said, please type slowly in the main search bar!</p>
<p>Included is also a fun little <code>route</code> that leads to searching everything cats.</p>
<h3 id="things-that-can-be-improved-on">Things that can be improved on</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>The biggest challenge for me was displaying the search history for the search bar. Granted, I made it hard for myself with searching with every <code>onChange</code>, which would also not be performant wise in a production setting. Perhaps I could&#39;ve submitted a request to the API after a slight pause if given more time!</p>
</li>
<li><p>Introduce Redux into the project. Given what my app is doing, Redux would be the perfect candidate rather than the unidirectional data flow of this app.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Unit testing! Testing is very under-appreciated, and though it makes development slow, it makes the application more solid.</p>
</li>
<li><p>dont push to master</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="lastly">Lastly</h3>
<p>However the implementation of the app, I am passionate about having a good UI, and on top of loving React, I love CSS/SASS. I try to keep my conventions close to BEM CSS.</p>
<p>Thank you if you&#39;ve read this far!</p>
